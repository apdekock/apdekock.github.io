I am a passionate software developer who views information technology as an enabler. I delight in exercising and reading. I have recently completed a Masters degree in Information Technology with a mini-dissertation, combining research into the SOA and MDE fields, by generating architectural views of software systems from a DSL. I believe in working interdependently and in continuously developing my own skills through collaboration and knowledge sharing.

My current interests include: Software Architecture, Leadership, Business Development, Quality Driven Delivery, Agile Development Practices and Scrum.
