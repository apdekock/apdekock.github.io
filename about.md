I am a passionate IT professional who views information technology as an enabler. I have completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology with a dissertation in the field of software architecture (IEEE 42010-2011).

I believe in working interdependently with others and in continuously developing my own skills through collaboration and knowledge sharing. I enjoy working with teams and believe I have gained a lot of experience by playing team sports for the majority of my life.

My areas of expertise include: Software Development, Software Architecture, Leadership, Business Development, Quality Driven Delivery, Agile Development Practices and Scrum.
