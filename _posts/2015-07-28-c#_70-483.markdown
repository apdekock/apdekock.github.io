I just passed the Programming in C# Microsoft Exam (Exam 70-483).

# Preparation
I read through the [Exam Ref 70-483: Programming in C#](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-70-483-programming-in-c-sharp-9780735676824) book (by Wouter de Kort).

It was a great help to brush up on any rusty pockets of knowledge. I find I've touched on all of the content practically but not always for extended periods of time or it was a while ago. At times the content in the book acquainted me with certain nuances I was oblivious to.

# Exam content distribution 
* Manage program flow (25%)
* Create and use types (24%)
* Debug applications and implement security (25%)
* Implement data access (26%)

_Now for: Exam Ref 70-486: Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Applications_

## **Moral:**

So what can we take from Phil's infinite wisdom?

  * "Success is 1% inspiration, 98% perspiration and 2% attention to detail." — Phil Dunphy [Phil’s-osophy]
 
    **_Brush up on the 2% of detail you don't know well by using that 1% inspiration to motivate you for the 98% perspiration required._**

	**_It all adds up to that 101% pass mark!_**
