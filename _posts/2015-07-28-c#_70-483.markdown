I just passed the MS Programming in C# (Exam 70-483).

# Preparation
I read through the [Exam Ref 70-483: Programming in C#](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-70-483-programming-in-c-sharp-9780735676824) book (by Wouter de Kort).

It was a great help to brush up on any rusty pockets of knowledge. I find I've touched on all of the content in this exam practically but not always for extended periods of time or it was a while ago it helped to refresh the knowledge and in at times acquainted me with certain nuances I was oblivious to.

# Exam content distribution 
Manage program flow (25%)
Create and use types (24%)
Debug applications and implement security (25%)
Implement data access (26%)

Now for: Exam Ref 70-486
