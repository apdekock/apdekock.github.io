In the spirit of continuous professional development and in pursuit of an MCSD, I recently wrote and passed the Developing ASP.NET MVC Web Applications Exam (Exam 70-486).

# Preparation
Like the previous exam (40-483), I read through one of the MS prescribed books for the exam: [Exam Ref 70-484: Developing ASP.NET MVC Web Applications](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-70-486-developing-asp.net-mvc-4-web-applications-9780735677227) book (by William Penberthy).

I also watched a few of the videos on [_Pluralsight_](http://blog.pluralsight.com/asp-net-mvc-microsoft-exam-70-486) - do this if you can - especially the security module. It was a great help to brush up on some of the lesser day-to-day used concepts and technologies. I was very selective as to which videos I watched as the total time for all the videos listed is over 60 hours. I did watch most of the first course: **Building Applications with ASP.NET MVC 4** and in hind sight, I would also recommend watching at least the introductory **Azure** courses, I'll probably focus on those for 70-487.

# Exam content distribution 

This time round - I learned much more than the previous C# exam. The MVC framework is huge and IIS as well as Azure and the surrounding technologies were very interesting. In the book I especially enjoyed the ability of the author to sketch practical scenario's and provide relevant applications of the technologies. In addition he was able to clarifying when a certain option is better, even though both options would work.

* Design the Application Architecture (20%-25%)
* Design the User Experience (15%-20%)
* Develop the User Experience (20%-25%)
* Troubleshoot and Debug Web Applications (20%-25%)
* Design and Implement Security (20%-25%)

_Now for: Exam Ref 70-487: Developing Windows Azure and Web Services_

## **Moral:**

So what can we take from Phil's infinite wisdom?
