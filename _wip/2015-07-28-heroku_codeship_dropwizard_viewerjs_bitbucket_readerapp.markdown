## Moral:

So what can we take from Phil's infinite wisdom?
  *"Watch a sunrise at least once a day." — Phil Dunphy [Phil’s-osophy]
 - Make a change at least once a day and see it applied near instantly, live on your site! 
 
 Cloud hosted source code management ([BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)), Continuous Integration & Delivery as a Service CI&DaaS(?) ([CodeShip](https://codeship.com/)) and PaaS provides you with true agilesque continuous delivery and besides, it's really satisfying having such a short feedback loop!
